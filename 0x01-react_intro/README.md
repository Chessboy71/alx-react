# Tasks

### 0. Basic application
```mandatory```
**Create a basic app named** ```dashboard``` **using** ```create-react-app``` **in your** ```task_0``` **directory**

You will need a favicon and the Holberton logo. Download them and add them to the ```src/``` directory under ```dashboard/```

**Holberton Logo**
![Holb logo](./assets/holb-logo.jpg "Logo")


**Favicon**

![alt text](./assets/fav.ico)


Remove the unused files:

- ```service-worker```
- ```index.css```
- ```App.test.js```

**in** ```task_0/dashboard/src/App.js```**, create a function** ```App``` **that returns:**

- a header div with a class named ```App-header``` containing the Holberton logo and a h1 with the text ```School dashboard```
- a body div with a class named ```App-body``` containing at least one paragraph with the text ```Login to access the full dashboard```
- a footer div with a class named ```App-footer``` containing at least one paragraph with the text ```Copyright 2020 - holberton School```

**Modify the App.css to make the project looks like the following screenshot:**

#### Requirements:

- When running, there should not be any lint error in the console

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: ```alx-react```
- Directory: ```0x01-react_intro```
- File: ```task_0/dashboards/src/```, ```task_0/dashboard/src/App.css```, ```task_0/dashboard/src/App.js```


### 2. Embedding expressions, functions
```mandatory```
**Using your code from the previous task, in** ```task_1/dashboard/src/utils.js```:

- Create a function named ```getFullYear``` that will return the current year
- Create a function named ```getFooterCopy```:
    - It accepts one argument ```isIndex```(boolean). When true, the function should return ```Holberton School```. When false, the function should return ```Holberton School main dashboard```
- Modify the footer returned in ```task_1/dashboard/src/App.js``` to use these two functions

**in** ```task_1/dashboard/src/Notifications.js```, **create a Notifications element**:

- It should import React
- It should export a function
- The function should return a ```div``` with the class ```Notifications```
- The div should contain a paragraph with the text ```Here is the list of notifications```
- import the file ```Notifications.css```.

**in ```task_1/dashboard/src/Notifications.css```, style the Notifications class**:

- Add a border and some padding around the div

**Render the Notifications element:**

- Modify ```task_1/dashboard/src/index.js``` to render the new element (```Notifications```) in a ```div``` named `root-notifications`
- Check that you can see the two elements on the browser, and using the React browser extension

**Requirements:**

- When running, there should not be any lint error in the console

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `alx-react`
- Directory: `0x01-react_intro`
- File: `task_1/dashboard/src/`, `task_1/dashboard/src/utils.js`, `task_1/dashboard/src/App.js`, `task_1/dashboard/src/Notifications.css`, `task_1/dashboard/src/Notifications.js`, `task_1/dashboard/src/index.js`
